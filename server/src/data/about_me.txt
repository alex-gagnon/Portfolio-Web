I started my career in software engineering roughly three years ago - stepping outside
of my comfort zone to pursue a greater challenge. Versality is my bread and butter. I embrace
the challenge of becoming a subject matter expert. Additionally, I specialize in adapting my
frame of mind for the task at hand. No matter how adept I become in a certain area, 
I'll never want to stop learning.

Much of my work involves testing consumer technology and enterprise technology. However, I'm
continually expanding my horizons. As a testing fiend, I love the thrill of uncovering what's 
inside the bottle. That hunger for personal and professional growth drives me forward.

What's next? I'm becoming proficient in other areas of the software development lifecycle
including DevOps, backend engineering, and frontend design. Lately, I have been enjoying 
building full-stack projects.
