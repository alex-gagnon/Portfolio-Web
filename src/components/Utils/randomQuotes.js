// 11. “Testers don’t like to break things; they like to dispel the illusion that things work.”— Kaner, Bach, Pettichord

// 12. “Pretty good testing is easy to do (that’s partly why some people like to say ‘testing is dead’– they think testing isn’t needed as a special focus because they note that anyone can find at least some bugs some of the time). Excellent testing is quite hard to do.”— James Bach
